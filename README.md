This add-on plays Cookie Clicker. Copy the contents of CookieClickerBot.js into the console in your browser (F12) and press Enter.

By default all it does is calculate the best thing to buy and print it in the console. It also has auto-buy and auto-click functionality, which you can toggle individually by typing startBuying(), stopBuying(), startClicking(), or stopClicking() into the console.

The start() function also takes arguments for these. To only turn on the autoclicker, type start(1, 0). To only turn on the autobuyer, type start(0, 1). To turn on both, type start(1, 1). To stop the add-on entirely, type stop().

The autoclicker clicks the cookie, golden cookies, reindeer, sugar lumps, etc., and gets various other achievements. It also changes the season to get drops.

The autobuyer buys buildings and upgrades, including Krumblor and Santa upgrades.

Dragon auras will only be set if the autoclicker and autobuyer are both active.

This add-on does not do ascensions or play mini-games.
