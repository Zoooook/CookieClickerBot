This add-on plays Cookie Clicker. Copy the contents of CookieClickerBot.js into the console in your browser (F12) and press Enter.

By default all it does is calculate the best thing to buy and print it in the console. It also has auto-buy and auto-click functionality, which you can toggle individually by typing startBuying(), stopBuying(), startClicking(), or stopClicking() into the console.

The start() function also takes arguments for these. To only turn on the autoclicker, type start(1, 0). To only turn on the autobuyer, type start(0, 1). To turn on both, type start(1, 1). To stop the bot entirely, type stop().
